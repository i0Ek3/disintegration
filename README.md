# disintegration

This repo used to record how I become an Algorithm Engineer(AI) through self-learning. To be honest, this progress need much time to complete. Actually this project also is a chance to chanllenge myself to force me life better and escape comfortable zone. And this repo's name also means what I thought: I will depart my past and hug new chapter.

## Plan

This project will contain some parts which I don't know yet, but I will upload my schedule ASAP.
